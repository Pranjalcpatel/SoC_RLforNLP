Have used Monte Carlo Method for optimal control
Getting a very noisy plot


Have checked the math by deploying the code on 2/3 iterations
All assumptions and explanations have been included in comments




  











Some inferences (which hold even in these noisy plots):
1. Clearly, for epsilon=0 (no exploration), there is a high chance of selecting a suboptimal policy
2. As epsilon increases, the agent also explores other outcomes and so the achieved reward is higher.
